# (WIP) phase

Using code transforming in your node apps without caring much about configurations.

## Cautions

You have to make sure your environments support `generator` as we have used a lot of `async/await`.

## Contribute

Make sure your nodejs version is equal or greater than `6`.


## TODO

- Check source map support of sub modules.
